## PAN-OS Device Management
This integration ingests PAN-OS NGFW and Panorama devices as indicators into the TIM database using a standard indicator fetch.

You must have a valid [Panorama API key](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-panorama-api/get-started-with-the-pan-os-xml-api/get-your-api-key) and access to the Panorama server from XSOAR.

This integration **must** be connected to Panorama and does not support direct connection to a PAN-OS NGFW specifically.
